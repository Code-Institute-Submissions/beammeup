            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>We are a Brighton based movie club with a passion from space-themed science-fiction (Sci Fi) films. We meet once a month on typically Fridays or Saturdays to enjoy films, socialise and have a general discussion afterwards regarding our thoughts on the films.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="about">
            <h3>How We Began</h3>
            <p>In December 2019, our founding members Emily and Sasha (the two women in the first image) wanted to set a New Years Resolution. This was to create a movie club with the specific interest in watching space themed science fiction films. They thought it would be a great way to meet other lovers of this genre and build new friendships. In addition, they felt it may engage others into finding a love for this genre and potentially joining as well. Therefore, in January 2022, they hosted their first club meet up which consisted of just the two of them. However, since then we have grown to sixteen members and are always looking for more friendly faces.</p>

            <h3>Why We Began</h3>
            <p>We wanted to meet other space-themed Sci fi movie lovers and encourage others to get into the genre. Therefore, we decided to build a movie club to socialise and meet other movie lovers who have an interest in this bracket of films. The name 'Beam Me Up', is a nod to our love for Star Trek. We thought it was very fitting due to our desire to want to be taken away from reality and immersed in the magic of Sci Fi cinema.</p>

            How We Review Movies
          </h3>
          <p>We don't provide official critical reviews on our movies. The purpose of the club is for recreational enjoyment. Our reviews provide more of a feel and opinion on how we found the films as a society. After each meet up, we discuss the film afterwards and one of the founds takes notes. We then compile this into a generalised review for existing members or new visitors to get an idea on whether they may be interested in the movie. </p>
