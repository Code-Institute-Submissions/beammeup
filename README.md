## 1. User Experience & Project Goals 

### First-time visitors

- For first-time visitors, I want them to understand what the website is about and who it is targeted too. 
- In addition, I want users to find information about the movie club, such as meet times, general information about the club so they can decide whether it something they would want to be a part of. 

### Movie Club members 

- I want the existing members to be able to view our events and meet up details with ease. 
- Furthermore, I would like existing members to view our conjoined reviews of films as a club and still be able to contact formally through our club site, should they have any questions. 

### All visitors

- I want visitors to find the site easy to navigate. 
- I want the home page to invite them into sci-fi notalgia but with still a modern feel. 
- I want visitors to be able to contact the site organisers with ease about any queries they may have. 
- I want visitors to see images of on the about page of our club meeting for movie watching to highlight the social aspect of the club. 
- I want visitors to have easy access to the location of our meet ups via google maps on the website, so they can easily attend meet ups. 

## 2. Features 

### Current Features

-__Navigation Bar__

- On all three pages, there is a navigation bar that is full responsive. The navigation bar includes a the movie club's logo 'Beam Me Up', the Home Page, the About page, the movie review page and the contact page. I have created each the same on each page for ease of navigation. However, there is a difference on the contact page. When you hover over the link is highlights #fff instead of #orange like the others. This is because contacting about joining the club and/or any queries are vital. Therefore, I wanted it have a different identifier to the others to stick out from the other links in on the navigation bar. 
- The navigation bar will allow the user to easily navigate from each page (and across all devices) without having to regress back to the previous page. 

POTENTIALLY INSERT LOGO SCREEN SHOT

-__The landing page background image__

The landing page includes a background image of an astronaught. The background image is meant to give an eye-catching feel of space-themes.

-__The landing page welcome introduction__

- There is a text overlay on the background image to the left of the landing page to highlight the name of the movie club and a brief description of what the club is; so an unknown vistor can immediately gauge the purpose of the site.

-__Contact Button__

- A button with the words 'join our club' features below the welcome introduction to encourage easy access to the contact page for visitors looking to join.

- The four card segments on the landing page will allow the user to have quick access to the most recent movies viewed by the club. 
- Each segment provides a direct link to each individual month's more detailed review on the website's movie page.
- The four card segments have a space-themed background to match the space-themed science-fiction theme of the movie club.

## Technologies Applied

### Languages Utilised 

To create this website, I have used two languages, HTML and CSS.

### Other Technologies

- Font Awesome: Used for all iconography.
- Google Development Tools: Used to test/ troubleshoot any issues and find solutions. In addition, to review the websites responsiveness on different device dimensions.
- Github: Used to save and store all the files for Beam Me Up.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

To test my code, I used W3C Validator for both HTML and CSS.

### Bugs 

1. 

2. Despite the navbar being fixed, when on the contact page the form would overlap and cover the navabar when scrolling. This would prevent users from being able to easily access the menu at all times. They would have to scroll all the way to the top on just the contact page which does not fit flush with the rest of the website, that can access the fixed navbar at all times when scrolling. While reading on W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.asp) I was reminded about z-index. Therefore, to resolve the issued, I set the navbar to z-index 999 to guarantee it would always be stacked in front of other elements.

- Dom from 'dcode' Youtube Channel: His code for creating an Accordian was how I created my drop down box on the movies review page. I changed parts to suit my website but I directly used the triangle image he has for the drop down symbol.
