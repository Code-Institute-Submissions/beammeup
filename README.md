Movie Club members

- Furthermore, I would like existing members to view our conjoined reviews of films as a club and still be able to contact formally through our club site, should they have any questions. 

All visitors

- I want visitors to find the site easy to navigate. 
- I want the home page to invite them into sci-fi notalgia but with still a modern feel.
