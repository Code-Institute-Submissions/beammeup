                <b>Review:</b> This film displayed the skill of an intelligent director touching upon the complex topic that is 'extraterrestrial life'. The sheer brilliance of the concept and thought provoking ideas, were beautifully captured within this movie as a whole. We as a club agree that we were captivated by this film, beginning to end. This film is not your regular alien invasion action thriller, with gore and destruction. This movie offers a more philosophical approach to how our world could react to such a unique invasion. We highly recommend this film. Overall, we would like to see this film again.

                          <b>Review:</b> On the surface, one could assume this movie was just another Tom Cruise action packed movie that lacks plot but has a lot of cool explosions and car chases. We were sorely mistaken, this movie provided a wonderful amount of suspense and curiosity. The CGI in the movie was executed well, the script was well thought out. The reason we have not rated this movie any higher is because the final moments of the movie show to be a bit ridiculous. However, we appreciate that this is fiction and still thought it was a satisfactory way to bring the film to an end.

                            <b>Review:</b> Ex Machina is a great film and story, despite the final third of the movie highlighting some plot holes. Generally the film achieves what is set out to accomplish. Each scene brings tension, leading to a climatic finally. The acting was sublime and despite being a film of technology, which would typically invite a more logical thought process; the movie has a very artistic beauty layered into it. The overall message of the film is spot on as humanity questions are relationship with AI advancements.

                              <b>Review:</b> Director Ridley Scott makes the most of a superb script, as one astronaught is stranded on the big red planet, Mars. The film beautifully brings Andy Weir's 2011 novel to life on the big screen. It has a wonderful realism as it has been based on theoretical science given humans have not yet ventured mars terrain. The film was a very good attempt at condensing the book, however the reason we have not given this film the full five stars is because the film did not capture the humour and lonliness of the lead character as well as it could have. The book provided a great internal monologue whereas the film lacked this a restricted the audience to limited emotions and consequently stunting the complexity of Matt Damon's character compared to the book. Nonetheless, the overall message of this story is so heart-warming and Matt Damon certainly has you routing for him to succeed and survive.

                  <b>Review:</b> Firstly, the visual effects for this movie are outstanding, it is one of the main factors that carries this film. Secondly, the acting was brilliant; Sandra Bullock and George Clooney really brought to life these characters with great intelligence and charisma. However, as a club we really felt the plot was lacking. We found it to be a bit boring and slightly predictable. When you compare the plot of similar space movies like The Martian or Interstellar, they have so much more to bring to the table than this movie did.

                            <b>Review:</b> For pure entertainment, this is a great space-themed sci-fi movie. We can forgive the special effects on the movie given that the film was released in 1998. The acting at times could be a little ham but for nostalgia purposed the club holds this film close to their hearts. The plot is ridiculos but incredibly entertaining and some aspects to it could very well happen to Earth one day. The story is intense and action pact but with a sprinkle of stupidity added into the concoction.

                              <b>Review:</b> An overwhelming majority of the club felt that this has become their favourite space-themed sci-fi film to date. Time and space are two crucial phenomenons that keeps humanity curious about our infinate universe. The highly talented Christopher Nolan demonstates his incredible directorial skills to generate this marvel of a movie. Interstellar is a ground-breaking movie, showing the hardships humans endure to try and find a new home after Earth has been disease ridden; consequently limiting food supplies. The acting was impecicable and truly immersed you into the experience. The emotion of the movie was driven by Hans Zimmer's impactful sound. Not many movies have touched on black holes, due to their mystery yet Christopher Nolan gave this a shot and did a great job and ultimatly gave a mind-blowing experience to the viewer. A full 5 stars from all the members of 'Beam Me Up'.
